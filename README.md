# FITing-Tree-with-OptimalPLR

A FITing-Tree (SIGMOD'19) implementation. The upper layer uses stx::btree, and the lower layer uses OptimalPLR algorithm (VLDBJ'14) to train a piecewise linear model. The OptimalPLR algorithm is a part of PGM-index (PVLDB'20), which is implemented by Giorgio Vinciguerra.
